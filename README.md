cavemode
========

Cavemode is stand-alone version of the Orchestrate.io API for use in caves (or anywhere else without access to wifi).

The Orchestrate.io API is fully supported.  Lucene search capability is minimally supported, but is probably sufficient for a development/test environment.

Written in go, cavemode leverages the gorest and go-leveldb golang packages.  Runs on MacOSX and Linux.

Requires go v1.2.
