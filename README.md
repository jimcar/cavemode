cavemode
========

Cavemode is a stand-alone implementation of the Orchestrate.io API for use in caves (or anywhere else without access to wifi).

The Orchestrate.io API is fully supported.  Lucene search capability is minimally supported, but is probably sufficient for use in a test/development environment.

Written in go, cavemode leverages the gorest and go-leveldb golang packages. Requires go v1.2.

Runs on MacOSX and Linux.
